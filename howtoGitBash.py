# This is just a text file. Remembering how to make files via Git Bash.
"""
I don't really remember the specifics of Git Bash and Git Hub, so I apologize
if I accidentally misunderstand terms of the process of editting/saving a file.

Fun fact, this py file was once named "t2.py" but I changed the name to 
"howtoGitBash.py." This created two of the same files, but with different names,
in the repository. Even after deleting t2.py from my own folder, it still existed
in the repository. So, to delete a file from the repository, hit the trashcan icon
at the top right of the code, and hit "commit changes" at the bottom to confirm
that you are removing a file from the repository.

# (after you've opened up Git Bash in the folder) 

# To pull a py file: git pull origin main
# Pulls all files from the repository 

# To add your editted file: git add INSERT_NAME.py

# To commit your file to the repository on Git Hub: git commit -m "INSERT TEXT"
