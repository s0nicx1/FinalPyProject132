Colin: Made it using Tech with Tim's version of a space game. However, I don't plan on
using a complete copy of his code. If we're going to add a bunch more sprites and functions,
I'd rather use classes, where we can show off our knowledge of inheritance, polymorphism;
the whole shebang. It could get messy, and will definitely be lots of lines of code,
but I think it's better than having a function for each sprite on the screen.
If none of this code makes sense, just watch the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO6qQDNa2UY
